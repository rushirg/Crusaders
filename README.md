# Smart_Bin
Smart-Bin is an upgradable version of the normal dustbin. In which once the bin is full it sends an SMS to a local authority regarding the current condition of that particular dustbin, the authority then can see the location of the dustbin and it's state whether it's full or empty, along with the same information about other bins.
